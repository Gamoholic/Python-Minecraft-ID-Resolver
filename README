WARNING!!! Please only run this script on a brand new server. In its current state it would wreak havoc on anything but a new server.



How to use:

Place id_resolver.py in your server directory. 
Run "python id_resolver.py"



Explanation of the output:

The first section of output displays all the files the script could not find a match in, as well as what type of match it was looking for.

The next section is a CSV ready output of the ID blocks that were handed out to the configs. If a section is blank that means the script was unable to find an ID section to rewrite.

The last section just displays the last IDs that were handed out.
